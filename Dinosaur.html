      Like my <a href="KeyWestAdventure.html">Key West Adventure Playground</a>, this is another playground to incorporate things I've learned. This one isn't used as often but as i find cool and interesting tricks, such as the text and image animation above, I incorporate them here just to see how they look and work on a webpage. Then I can manipulate the code and play around with it to find out what I can build and create with it.

    <p class="lead px-5 " > 
        Dinosaurs amaze and astound us all. Such huge creatures as modern humans have 
        never seen. Fascination rooted in childhood and follows us to adults. And 
        further with the Jurassic Park movie franchise. This website is an experiment 
        in education for me. One part putting code skills to use and learning how to 
        do things. Second part learning about dinosaurs. And seriously, who doesn't 
        want to know more about Dino?<br></p> 

        <br>
        
        <p class="px-4" >One of my first questions I wanted to know was about the name. <em>Dinosaur.</em><br>
        Where does that come from? How do you come up with that name? <em><strong>Dinosaur!</strong></em><br>
        It certainly conjures up only one thing where you read it! Turns out, it should a bit silly. "Terrible Lizard."<br>
        <a href=https://www.etymonline.com>Online Etymology Dictionary</a> 
        is a great resource for word nerds like me. From there I learned;<br>
        <br></p>

        
          <figure class="text-center">
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p><em>"one of the Dinosauria, a class of extinct Mesozoic reptiles often of enormous size, 1841, coined in Modern Latin by Sir Richard Owen, from Greek deinos "terrible" (see dire) + sauros "lizard" (see -saurus). Figurative sense of "person or institution not adapting to change" is from 1952. Related: Dinosaurian."</em></p>

            <p class="px-4"> According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word is made up from two parts. 
                Dino (Latin) from Dire which possibly comes from ancient Oscan and Umbrian and 
                perhaps Greek for <em>deinos</em> meaning "terrible." <br>
                Of course there's much more to it than that but I'll leave you to the searching 
                and reading further.<br>
                <br>
                The last part -saurus is the Latinized form of a Greek word meaning Lizard.<br>
                Thus we have "Terrible Lizard."<br>
                Personally, I like Dinosaur better.</p>
