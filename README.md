# Web Developer Page and portfolio of William D. Vest

My portfolio shows the good, the bad, and the ugly... and the progress I have made as a coder. From my beginning, through my classes with [Colt Steele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/ "Colt's Linkedin")
and [Angela Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu-963a584b/?originalSubdomain=uk "Angela's Colt's Linkedin") on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ "Udemy") and then with [Commonwealth Coders](https://commonwealthcoders.com/ "Commonwealth Coders") (a state sponsored education program for those affected by losing jobs due to Covid) where I earned my first certificate.

Pages may contain many unnecessary elements and design features. Only added here for practice and examples.


### Landing Page
+ Navbar & Footer
  - Bootstrap
+ Neon Text
  - Sourced from https://codemyui.com/, tweaked slightly to fit my needs including image. 
+ The 80's
  - iframe arcade game links from retrogames.cc. At creation, this worked well. Since then, the links have died one by one. Will have to be recreated.
+ Web Dev Skills
  - What we, as students of Commonwealth Coders, were encouraged to add. We were not trained in many of them. 
+ Social Media Links
  - Added reluctantly. I do not keep up with writing articles or tweeting about tech or much of anything. I code. I don't write about it. Added only because it seems to be the standard.
