My portfolio shows the good, the bad, and the ugly... and the progress I have made as a coder. From my beginning, through my classes with [Colt Steele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/ "Colt's Linkedin")
and [Angela Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu-963a584b/?originalSubdomain=uk "Angela's Colt's Linkedin") on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ "Udemy") and finally from [Commonwealth Coders](https://commonwealthcoders.com/ "Commonwealth Coders") (a state sponsored education program for those affected by losing jobs due to Covid) where I earned my first certificate.
